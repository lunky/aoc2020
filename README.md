# aoc2020
Advent of Code - my solutions

Uses haskell stack [http://www.haskellstack.org]

Run tests with  `stack test`  (I always run with `stack test --file-watch`)

Run exe with `stack exec aoc2020-exe`

I always seem to only run the `main` from within the repl
`stack ghci`
I load Main with `:l Main` and run the main module with `main`


This is just for me, creates a new source file and test as well as making an empty data file.
`stack runghc script/Advance.hs`
