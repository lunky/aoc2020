# aoc2020
Advent of Code - my solutions

uses haskell stack [http://www.haskellstack.org]

run tests with  `stack test`  (I always run with `stack test --file-watch`)

there's currently something wrong with building the aoc2020x-exe but I only 
ever seem to run the `main` from within the repl
`stack ghci`
I load Main with `:l Main` and run the main module with `main`


this is just for me, creates a new source file and test as well as making an empty data file.
`stack runghc script/Advance.hs`
